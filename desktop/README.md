3. The default port is 8000 (you can change it if needed)
4. Click "Start Server" to begin listening for connections
5. Note down the connection information shown:
   - Either Ethernet (LAN) IP: (e.g., 192.168.56.1)
   - Or WiFi IP: (e.g., 192.168.1.6)

## Network Requirements
- Your mobile device must be on the same local network as the PC

### Lost Connection?
